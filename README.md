## Hey Guys! This is Human Not Robot ðŸ¤–

## About Me

This is **Mohamed seif** I'm a junior data scientist, software engineer, and programming instructor from Egypt ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¬.
My journey in tech is all about blending data-driven insights with robust software solutions and sharing knowledge with others.

As a data scientist, I work with Python, MySQL, and SQLAlchemy to analyze data, and visualize the data using matplotlib, seaborn, plotly charts and dashboards, create ETL processes, and build machine learning models to turn complex data into clear, actionable insights.ðŸ”ŽðŸ”Ž

My software engineering background allows me to approach problems from multiple angles, creating efficient and scalable solutions.

I've also had the exciting opportunity to work as a programming instructor. Collaborating with two other instructors, we developed and delivered a comprehensive C++ Object-Oriented Programming workshop. This experience not only sharpened my technical skills but also enhanced my ability to work in a team and communicate complex ideas effectively.

From crafting data visualizations to coding robust applications and guiding new programmers, I'm always eager to learn and take on new challenges in this ever-evolving field.

Check out my projects to see how I'm growing and applying my skills, I am open to any advice or suggestions ðŸš€
